title: PHP needs a better bridge
---

I learned PHP because I needed to coerce WordPress 2.5 into being a CMS for a client's website. I was pretty new to the full-stack freelancer gig, and by "pretty new" I mean completely and totally unqualified with absolutely no experience with anything but HTML and CSS and maybe a little JavaScript.

I think the PHP community has a bad reputation because of people like me who were able to so easily fake it as a "programmer" (I never used that word to describe myself until very recently) by throwing together a few functional PHP scripts. You have to know something about the command line and about servers and about _programming_ to get a simple Ruby or Python or Java project up and running. With PHP, you can install MAMP and get a script running in a few minutes.

That kind of learning curve is usually described as a strength of PHP, but it encourages a culture of sloppy, irresponsible code. It's possible to do "real" programming in PHP and I've been learning a ton about just that over the last 2 years. But the path from WordPress hacker to programmer wasn't clear to me at all. We don't have a bridge. 

### Why do you hate WordPress?

I like WordPress a lot, actually. And if all you need to do is get a Loop running, maybe you don't need to worry about anything else, but I think a lot of WordPress developers could become better at WordPress (or Drupal, or whatever) by learning about programming in general. This isn't about "Fuck WordPress use a real framework", this is about becoming a better community of code writers together.

That's why we need a bridge.
