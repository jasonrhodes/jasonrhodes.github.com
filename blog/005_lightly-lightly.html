    <p class="byline">Posted by Jason Rhodes on January 8th, 2015</p>
    <div class="container post-container"><p>A friend mentioned this quote yesterday and I keep going back to it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s dark because you are trying too hard.<br>Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. </p>
<p>Yes, feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.</p>
<p>Aldous Huxley</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve always been an intense person in many ways. I squeeze down hard on good times for maximum pleasure extraction and I squeeze equally hard on bad times ... I don&#39;t know why? I think maybe to fix them? I&#39;d already been thinking a lot about gentle grips--on friendships, on good feels, on future worry, on anything. </p>
<p>So then that quote came along and, oh. Yeah, that&#39;s exactly it, Aldous. Good job. </p>
<p>Lightly, lightly. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Update (10/2015)</strong>: It doesn&#39;t go very well. Lightly is hard.</p>
