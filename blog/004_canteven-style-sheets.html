<p>Whenever I say that I really hate CSS, people <em>seem</em> to make one of several assumptions about me. Either I don&#39;t understand it very well, or I come from back-end development/computer science and I&#39;m being disparaging or patronizing toward it.</p>
<p>Which is funny, because I don&#39;t come from a back-end/computer science background or from a design and art background. I come to the web from a nothing background, kind of. A &quot;Religious Studies and Sociology double major&quot; background, if you will. Never mind. I stumbled onto &quot;web stuff&quot; in a Barnes and Noble where I&#39;d discovered Jeffrey Zeldman&#39;s <em>Designing with Web Standards</em>, which I read/skimmed while sitting on the floor for about an hour that day and then went back to revisit several times after that.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I just realized I probably should have bought the book at some point--sorry Zeldman, B&amp;N, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote a ton of HTML and CSS back then and cobbled together some PHP and built shitty websites for people, the way you do. I wasn&#39;t a great designer and I knew fuck-all about programming, but I really loved making things out of HTML and CSS. I read A List Apart and had a Google Reader list full of Meyer and Shea and Zeldman and Cederholm etc. In 2009 I paid for my own flight to San Francisco and a not-cheap ticket to go to An Event Apart where I met Ethan Marcotte and saw Nicole Sullivan talk about Object Oriented CSS. I rode the wave of CSS3. I supported IE6. I memorized float hacks and quirks mode and all the rest.</p>
<hr>
<p>I say all of that kind of annoying shit to make it clear that I <em>know</em> CSS and I <em>appreciate</em> its power and complexity and usefulness.</p>
<p>But then I discovered this talk by Rich Hickey called <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a> and I watch it a few times a year now. Hickey created a language called Clojure which I know almost nothing about, and which I have no plans to learn. But this talk, <em>ohhhh</em> this talk. A few of the things that stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is a prerequisite to reliability<br>--Edsger Dijkstra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple is different than easy and better than complex: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/resource/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/en/slides/sl3.jpg">infoq.com/resource/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/en/slides/sl3.jpg</a></p>
<p>Simple is one braid:  </p>
<ul>
<li>one role</li>
<li>one task</li>
<li>one concept</li>
<li>one dimension</li>
</ul>
<p>Four truths:   </p>
<ul>
<li>We can only hope to make reliable those things we can understand</li>
<li>We can only consider a few things at a time</li>
<li>Intertwined things must be considered together</li>
<li>Complexity undermines understanding</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/resource/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/en/slides/sl7.jpg">Limits!</a></p>
<p>&quot;complect&quot; -&gt; to interleave, intertwine<br>&quot;compose&quot; -&gt; to place together</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming ... boils down to no more and no less than very effective thinking so as to avoid unmastered complexity, to very vigorous separation of your many different concerns<br>--Edsger Dijkstra</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>CSS is <strong>complected by design</strong>. The cascade is complection by definition. Complected Style Sheets, pretty much. Consider this CSS:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">section</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.container</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: red;
}

<span class="hljs-selector-tag">body</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">section</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: green;
}
</code></pre>
<p>What background color is that div?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine if collisions like this were a compile-time syntax error...</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you said &#39;red&#39; because the class selector is more specific than the element selector, you might be right. But the best answer is probably &quot;no idea&quot; because you don&#39;t know if there&#39;s another matching selector further down the page, or a slightly more specific one anywhere else, or inline styles in the HTML, or a matching !important declaration anywhere...</p>
<p>The fact is that you can&#39;t look at a decent-sized set of stylesheet selectors and confidently figure out what the effect is until you see it in the browser. That should terrify you, I think.</p>
<p><em>[A bunch of hands in the room go up.]</em></p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just a side-effect of <em>bad</em> CSS, either.</p>
<p><em>[Hands go down.]</em></p>
<p>The cascade is designed to tempt you to override all the things, ie overload and complect. You could have defined a whole set of carefully set CSS properties and one of them can be so easily over-ridden by any other matching selector somewhere else in your stylesheet system. In programming we borrowed a term for this from Einstein, called &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. It&#39;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>This article from <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/427174/einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-paradox-older-than-thought/">Technology Review</a> explains a little about spooky action using the term &quot;entanglement&quot;. A couple of good quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entanglement occurs when two particles are so deeply linked that they share the same existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entangled particles can become widely separated in space. But even so, the mathematics implies that a measurement on one immediately influences the other, regardless of the distance between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is generally a bad thing and makes it hard for you to reason about what&#39;s happening in your code. Which makes it harder to change and harder to debug and harder to maintain as it grows.</p>
<p>So we have a language that&#39;s built on the idea that complection, or cascade, is fundamentally good when in traditional programming we try to avoid it if we can. You have selector specificity that relies on a formula that&#39;s nearly impossible to remember, and pretty much any CSS loaded anywhere is &quot;global&quot; and can affect any other CSS loaded in a &#39;spooky at a distance&#39; kind of way. So what did we do with that system?</p>
<p>We built another level of complection right on top of it, of course! Enter: media queries. Now depending on the state of the browser, which you can&#39;t replicate outside of the browser, different sections of global cascading CSS selectors will apply and override other global cascading CSS selectors. Perfect! Now you can have this situation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">@media (<span class="hljs-attribute">max-width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">600px</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-selector-class">.container</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: green;
  }
}

<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
}

<span class="hljs-selector-class">.nav</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: black;
}
</code></pre>
<p>What color is the link? Now it&#39;s dependent on the cascade, the HTML structure it&#39;s within <em>and</em> the width of the browser, which I understand is by design for <em>very good reasons</em> but wow does it make it hard to think about anything!</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You could argue that CSS good practices and general programming good practices are opposites in some regard. Embracing the cascade and leveraging it, like mobile-first responsive design encourages you to do, is opposite to the advice that you should keep code simple and de-coupled from other parts of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So I get it, there&#39;s no better solution that I know of besides CSS and media queries. We have to use them, it&#39;s the only visual design solution we have and when we use them intelligently they can do some powerful, awesome things. But they&#39;re difficult and susceptible to inflexibility and strange frustrating bugs and other common problems because the system is built on the idea that complecting is good and should be leveraged. That&#39;s hard to overcome.</p>
<p>I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing so many new CSS strategies designed to avoid and ignore the cascade altogether. <a href="https://bem.info/method">BEM</a>, for instance, <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> to some extent, <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a> (not very new) -- and a bunch of other even newer CSS abstractions and strategies aimed at adding descriptive classes to nested elements and <em>sidestepping the cascade</em> to create a more reliable, simple system. </p>
<p>Simplifying, decomplecting. Good things, in my opinion, for how to deal with what we&#39;re dealt. Because CSS isn&#39;t going anywhere and we sure as hell need it.</p>
<p>::still thinking through more ways to overcome this problem::</p>
