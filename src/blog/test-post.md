Writing some stuff. Why don't I do this more often where I don't let myself filter anything I want to type? Do I fear my subconcscious so much that I run from it scared like it could potentially out me as a person who is weird but really I know that anyone I know already knows that I am weird.

Post post post post post. 

So much.
