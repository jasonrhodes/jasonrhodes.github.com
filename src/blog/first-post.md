summary: If you like to eat bananas then you might just like this post. Then again you may not because it doesn't have much to do with bananas. In fact nothing, really.

Writing some stuff. Why don't I do this more often where I don't let myself filter anything I want to type? Do I fear my subconcscious so much that I run from it scared like it could potentially out me as a person who is weird but really I know that anyone I know already knows that I am weird.

Post post post post post. 

So much.
