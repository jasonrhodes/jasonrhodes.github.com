              <h3>Melisandre and The Very Long Night</h3>
              <p class="post-teaser">Imagine that on the evening of this past week&#39;s episode of Game of Thrones, titled The Long Night, you were running a bit late on your way to your Thrones watch party. You race down the street going a safe but calculated 11 MPH over the speed limit but, as luck would have it, you&#39;ve hit three straight red lights and your patience is running out. As you wait at the third one for what seems like a Westerosi winter, you remember something in the back of your mind: isn&#39;t there some trick with traffic lights where you can force them to change by flashing your car&#39;s bright headlights at them?</p></a></li>

              <h3>I accidentally built a form library</h3>
              <p class="post-teaser">This is a story about how I accidentally built another form library for React, and about how that library works, and about how React context works. Like so many things in the late 2010s, it starts with a podcast.</p></a></li>

              <h3>Easy Heroku-like git deployments with Dokku and Digital Ocean</h3>
              <p class="post-teaser">tl;dr I&#39;m gonna explain how I just set up a Digital Ocean server so I can deploy apps to it with git push, and oh btw I accidentally got custom DNS subdomain management (via nginx) because Dokku is p cool.</p></a></li>

              <h3>AirPlay Problems Disappear With This One Weird Trick!</h3>
              <p class="post-teaser">I bought an Apple TV for my living room when we cut DirecTV earlier this year, but the AirPlay mirroring feature never worked. Today, I finally discovered why, kind of, or at least how to fix it, I think.</p></a></li>

              <h3>Hey Baltimore JavaScripters, what's up?</h3>
              <p class="post-teaser">We&#39;re currently planning our fourth NodeSchool event here in Baltimore. And when I say &quot;we&quot;, I mean I. I&#39;m doing it. It turns out that delegation and community organization are hard work. Who knew? (I knew, but still.)</p></a></li>
