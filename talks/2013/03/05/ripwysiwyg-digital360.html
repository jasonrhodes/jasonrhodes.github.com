  <h1>RIP WYSIWYG: How structured content will make you skinny, happy, and rich</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We build templates for our websites to control the design and layout and make it consistent across all of our pages. But when it comes to the Big Huge Area of Most Important Content on Every Page, we force the content creators and maintainers to be designers and layout-ers.</p>
<p>When we were asked to build a news site for Johns Hopkins, we decided to make our jobs a lot harder and build a news site on top of a news API on top of a news database. Building a system like that required us to break up our content into structured chunks and store each piece individually. It was hard, it took a long time, and we made a ton of mistakes, but we are on our way to building a really powerful system that provides infinitely reusable content to everyone in our institution.</p>
